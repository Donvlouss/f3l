# F3l Surface
Compute features of surface.

## Convex Hull
Implement QuickHull.

Support 2D and 3D data.

## Concave Hull
Support 2D and 3D (partial) data.

In 3D data, would segment a plane then rotate data to make the plane lies on XY dimension, then compute 2D.

## Delaunay
Implement [Bowyerâ€“Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm).

Currently, 2D only. Would compute multiple shapes in data, and triangles and contours of each shape.
